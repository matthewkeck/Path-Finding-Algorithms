# Path-Finding-Algorithms
This project was created in Java. It has a graphical user interface that allows the user to select start and finishing nodes in a generated maze. Then the user will choose an algorithm to generate a maze and find a path through the said maze. The path-finding algorithms the user can select from are breadth search, depth search, and a star. the maze generation algorithms are randomly generated, depth generated, and recursively divided generation.
